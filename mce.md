#MCE Positive Tech

### 2 intensive days of absorbing knowledge, inspiring yourself and networking 

Our conference is made by a team of engineers and designers who work together as a good and effective team. We seek for the same positive bunch of talented people and create this event for both of them. You will find lectures devoted to designers and engineers separately, as well as a huge dose of topics suitable for both of them. All combined by positive tech, accessibility and social economy!
