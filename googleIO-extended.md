I/O Extended events include a variety of options for developersâ€”from live streaming sessions to local demos, hackathons, codelabs, and more. These events are hosted in your neighborhood by local developer communities.

#### In 2016, 600+ I/O Extended events were held around the world. Many more of you joined us online. A big thank you - we hope to see you again this year.
